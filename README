NAME
    SecondLife::DataTypes - Support for parsing, working with and printing
    Second Life's data types

VERSION
    version 0.900

SYNOPSIS
        use SecondLife::Rotation;
        my $null_rot = SecondLife::Rotation->new("<0,0,0,1.0>");

        # or

        use SecondLife::DataTypes qw( slrot );
        my $null_rot2 = slrot "<0,0,0,1.0>";

        print $null_rot2->s,"\n"; # 1.0
    
        use SecondLife::DataTypes qw( slvec );
        my $cyan = SecondLife::Vector->new("<0,1,1>");
        my $rec = slvec '<1,0,0>';
    
        use SecondLife::DataTypes qw( slregion );
        my $region = SecondLife::Region->new("Dew Drop (236544, 242944)");
        my $region2 = slregion 'Dew Drop (236544, 242944)'; # same

DESCRIPTION
    This module loads the other SecondLife data type modules and optionally
    provides sugar for creating new instances of them from strings.

FUNCTIONS

    Create a new SecondLife::Rotation object from a string.

  slvec(Str $vec_str) returns SecondLife::Vector
    Create a new SecondLife::Vector object from a string.

  slregion(Str $region_str) returns SecondLife::Region
    Create a new SecondLife::Region object from a string
